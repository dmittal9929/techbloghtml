      Pros: When I got the RTX 3070 I decided to stick it in an older system that has an i5-6600k with 16gb of RAM, 1080p 144hz monitor. Man.... did the 6600k ever BOTTLENECK. I tried playing FFXV and not only was the CPU usage pegged at or near 100% constantly, but the framerates would drop about every 30 seconds. After seeing a few other games suffer with the 6600k, I put the 3070 in another system with an i7-8086k @ 5.2ghz -2 AVX. Most of the time the GPU usage was around 60% to 70%. Intel's illustrious Quad-Core era is truly DEAD.

      EVGA card with the famous EVGA warranty. I've had to file a few RMA's with multiple companies over the years and EVGA is probably the best company to deal with.
      Lays waste to 1080p gaming. There's not really a better card for the job.
      <br>
      The cooler is probably overkill for the GPU..... but that's the way I like it. When I buy Graphics cards I tend to keep them around for a very long time and I'll pass them off to other family members.

      Nvidia drivers are always stable for the most part. I don't mind AMD cards, but if I put an AMD card in my brother's computer then the drivers will eventually mess up and I have to go over to his place and fix the drivers. We don't live in the same city so having to do this is a PITA.
      <br><br>
      Cons: The one thing I don't like about the RTX 3070 in general is the GTX/RTX XX70 series is usually within a good range of value for the dollar, but the RTX 3070 isn't. Oddly, This time around the RTX 3060ti is the better value. The RTX 3070 is kinda like the old GTX 580, 680, and 980 where paying the extra money for it didn't make sense from a value perspective. In a perfect world, or the old world that lacked miners and stock was abundant, I would tell anyone to either pay more for the RTX 3080 or get the RTX 3060ti. Right now it's every man for himself and get whatever you can get.

      I really don't think 8gb of VRAM is enough for the long term. Just look at the 3gb GTX 1060 if you want an example because that card was obsolete 2 years ago. In many ways the RX 6800 might be the better card, but at least the RTX 3070 is better with Ray Tracing and DLSS.
      <br><br>
      Overall Review: The cooler is overkill and I'm backed by the EVGA warranty so I give the product itself a 5 star rating. The RTX 3070 by itself I give a 3.5 out of 5 star for the lack of VRAM and being a poor value in comparison to the 3060ti. I'll betcha that by the end of the Ampere run in 2022, the early adopters will be laughed because 8gb of VRAM will only be enough for 1080p and there will be a Super series that has 16gb of VRAM in the 3070. The people who say 8gb or 10gb is enough will be eating their words.....Nom, Nom, Nom
