      Pros: - The performance is amazing! Coming from a Asus Strix 2080ti it is about 50%-60% performance uplift in games. More with ray tracing enabled.
      - The cooler on the FTW3 version is the highest quality cooler of the EVGA 3090 cards and it SHOWS! I overclocked this thing to 2.1ghz and it stays below 74 degrees! ( Make sure you have a good airflow case!)
      <br><br>
      Cons: - About a 3 slot card!
      - Requires ALOT of power. This card requires 3 SEPERATE PCIE power cables running from your PSU. You CAN NOT daisy chain. I have a UPS and I can read that this card sometimes spikes up to 600WATTS while under load! I have a Corsair HXI1200W Platinum PSU so I have the headroom. Make sure you do as well or your PSU will not make it.

      Overall Review: - Better performance than I ever expected! I run an ROG SWIFT 1440P 165hz monitor and games like Cyberpunk 2077 with EVERYTHING maxed out runs 65-100 FPS! I was also able to overclock this thing fairly high. Around 2ghz and 2.01ghz are the max STABLE that I got. That was 150 core/800 on the memory. Your mileage my vary of course. Overall this card seems overkill for even 1440p/165hz gaming as every other game I've played is maxed and not dropping below 60hz FULLY maxed! At 4K this card also kills everything. This is the best of the best! Hell it can play Doom eternal at 8K!!!
