    RX 6700XT. Good 1440p Mid-Range Card but Bit Overpriced.

            Pros: -Runs smoother than my 5700xt and higher frames. -12gb memory for those AAA games that are coming soon. Battlefield, FarCry, etc.-Runs 1440p great.
            <br><br>
            Cons: -Raytracing is not really optimal, and not worth purchasing this card just to have raytracing. -temps can run high but no shut downs/crashes with this card yet.-Streaming on this thing is better than my 5700xt, but it still has problems when the final output is put on twitch. It can have blocky, or pixelated anomalies. (could be my CPU)-2.9 slots used in PC, so you need a large case and I recommend a ATX vs ITX board. -I don't know how to use RGB software from ASUS, usually the program cannot detect the card and will not allow me to change the default RGB settings. -If you want to run this card in Crossfire with the same exact card, you may not be able to fit second card on to motherboard due to headers and wiring near 2nd PCIE slot and bottom of mother board. -Price is too high.

            Overall Review: So I bought this GPU to see what this thing offers over the 5700xt. It is a upgrade when it comes down to Frame Rates, and 1440p gaming. The Ray Tracing causes loss in frame rate and not really a useful thing in this card. I think of it as, a way to see whether you like raytracing or not. IDK. I play a lot of Rainbow Six Siege, and it was running a lot smoother and faster then my 5700xt. My mouse feels like I have changed my DPI or sensitivity settings. Feels good. I would also like to mention that Newegg did say the memory had a bandwidth of 256bit, but it is 192bit like every other 6700xt. I threw my 5700xt in my rig to see if it fits and I was able to have 2 GPU's running in my system, but not in Crossfire. Everything ran but it was a close fit. I would recommend this card to a friend if the price was right. But not for the current MSRP. But for other brand 6700xt's, buy it, if that is what you can get right now.
