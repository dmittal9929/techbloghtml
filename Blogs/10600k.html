      <strong>SPECIFICATIONS</strong>
      Architecture: Comet Lake | Socket: LGA 1200 | Cores/Threads: 6 / 12 | Base Frequency: 4.1GHz | Top Boost Frequency: 4.8GHz | TDP: 125W

      The reality of AMD's chip shortage has proven to be an Achilles heel, as you can't find its $300 Ryzen 5 5600X reliably in stock, which often leads to price gouging. That's where Intel's Core i5-10600K steps in. At $270, this speedy little chip doesn't claim outright benchmark supremacy over the Ryzen 5 5600X. Still, you probably won't notice the relatively slight differences in gaming when you pair the chip with a mid-range GPU or play at heightened fidelity settings.
      <br><br>
      The Core i5-10600K is incredibly competitive in both gaming and multi-threaded work, and given its friendly price tag, this chip takes our list as the top recommendation for gaming. Also, keep your eye out for the $237 version, the Core i5-10600KF, which comes without integrated graphics. If you plan to use a discrete GPU, this is your chip, as it is functionally the same as the standard model but comes at an absolute steal at $237. That is if you can't find a Ryzen 5 5600X in stock, of course.
      <br><br>
      The 10600K boosts to a peak of 4.9 GHz on two cores and can maintain a 4.6 GHz all-core frequency. The chip drops readily into either Z490 or 500-series motherboards and comes with an unlocked multiplier, meaning you are free to overclock. In fact, after tuning, the 10600K matches the Ryzen 5 5600X in gaming. It also supports PCIe 4.0 for the graphics card and a single M.2 slot.
      <br><br>
      The catch? The 10600K comes with a 125W PL1 rating, the same as the previous-gen 10600K, but has a 251W PL2, a whopping 69W increase compared to the previous 182W limit. That means you'll need a capable cooler to deal with the extra heat. Intel's K-series chips don't come with a cooler, so you'll have to budget one in if you pick the 11600K and also be willing to overlook its comparatively high power consumption.
