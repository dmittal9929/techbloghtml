    Apple Silicon M1. The Game Changer

      <strong>SPECIFICATIONS</strong>
      <br>
      CPU: 8-Core Apple Silicon M1
      <br>
      GPU: 8-Core M1 GPU
      <br>
      ML Processor: 16-core M1 Neural Engine
      <br><br>
      The Apple Silicon M1 System on a Chip (SOC), combined with some brilliant software from Apple, allows the new MacBook Pro to do things that no Intel-based laptop I've ever owned could do.
      <br>
      The fans almost never turn on, the chassis stays cool to the touch during the most extreme benchmarks, and every app we used, weather it was optimized for Apple Silicon or being emulated in real-time by Apple's Rosetta 2 software performed better than we expected.
      <br><br>
      Apple is much further ahead than anybody expected them to be with these 1st generation Apple Silicon devices. Rosetta 2 emulation is so good it's practically invisible, performance exceeds price point by a lot (at least by Apple standards), and efficiency is absolutely mind-blowing. I hoped for "good" with the ARM-based apps, and "Usable" with non-optimized apps; I did not expect improved performance at 1/4 the power draw and 3/4 the price.
      <br><br>
      But whether you need a new Mac right away or you're willing to wait and see what Apple sticks inside the iMac or next-gen 16-inch MacBook Pro, there's one thing I can say without any hesitation: this changes everything.
