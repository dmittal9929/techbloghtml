      Pros: -You get the performance of a 2060 Super and don’t have to pay nearly as much for it. -Small form factor so it fits in just about every build.-I will always recommend EVGA products, they have perhaps the best customer support and warranty track record of any company I’ve dealt with in the PC component arena.-A great over clocker with plenty of headroom for enthusiasts-They blacked out the 'red clown lips' these cards came with initially (thank you for listening EVGA) looks so much better this way.
      <br><br>
      Cons: -Thermals are bit higher than I’d like to see, even without an overclock, it’s going to need really good airflow to keep those temps down (in-game it was common to see 70C-75C without an overclock) my case has below average airflow so something like a meshify or similar will most definitely see better temps-No RGB anywhere on the card (this may be a pro in some people’s eyes but I prefer having the option and it’s a shame it wasn’t available on this model)
      <br><br>
      Overall Review: Aside from a few nit-picky things (see cons) it’s an absolute bargain if you can get it at around MSRP. Granted this particular EVGA models price is a bit inflated, I consider it worth it due to the fact that EVGA is so good at resolving any potential issues you might experience down the road and paying EVGAs asking price is much more palatable than paying a scalper
