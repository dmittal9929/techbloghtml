    RX 6900XT. It is big, powerful, and surprisingly quiet

            Pros: - The current top end of AMD GPUs. In many games this card trades blows with the RTX 3090.<br>
            - This XFX card is one of the fastest out of the box 6900xts.<br>
            - This card's fans are surprisingly quiet. I had a EVGA RTX 2080 Ti before this and that card's fans were much louder. The RTX fans would spool up and make a loud whooshing sound when starting up the PC. The XFX 6900xt was silent to the point I thought the card was DOA.
            <br>
            - The card does look pretty cool. The shroud, fans, and backplate are also very solid. <br>
            - The AMD drivers have come a long way since the last time I had an AMD card. These drivers were smart enough to automatically detect and set the proper screen resolution and refresh rate for my monitor.
            <br>
            - The AMD Radeon Software can do neat things like tell you average FPS in each game you play, grade how good the card performs, and advise you to turn up the settings or dial them back. You can also overclock the card, and monitor temperatures with AMD's own software..
            <br><br>
            Cons: - The card is quite long. The case I have has two fans in the front, I had to remove one to fit this card.
            <br>
            - Not as fast as Nvidia's RTX cards in games that utilize ray tracing.
            <br>
            - Like other cards this one is not easy to obtain.
            <br>
            - A bit on the pricey side.
            <br><br>
            Overall Review: In the current market where cards are hard to come by it is hard to be choosy. I was looking to upgrade to either the RTX 3090, 3080, AMD 6900xt, and 6800xt. When this one popped up as available I quickly jumped on it. So far I am not regretting my decision.
