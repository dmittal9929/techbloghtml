      Pros: - Runs exceptionally cool and quiet with great OC support
      - People complain about the massive RGB strip on the card but honestly it looks really cool and if it bothers you, Precision X1 software can be used to disable it completely
      <br><br>
      Cons: Slightly on the heavier side because of the massive cooler but that is really not a con. If you are too concerned about the weight and GPU sag, you can get a vertical support bracket for it.

      Overall Review: I waited patiently for my 3080 for close to 2 months after I had the rest of my brand new 2020 build ready and just sitting there waiting for a GPU. The frustration of not getting a GPU is real and I must admit my patience was wearing thin so in the end I never really had a particular 3080 card in mind, it was get what you can. And I was lucky enough to snag this baby one evening just randomly refreshing on Newegg and boy am I glad I got this one! FTW3 Ultra is top of the line without a doubt. I have had no problems with this card whatsoever. My card shipped without with ugly red lip which was an added bonus
