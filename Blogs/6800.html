            Pros: - Shipped within a day, arrived within 3 Days
            <br>
            - Very good performance out of the box and with a mild OC on top of that able to get very good performance out of this card
            <br>
            - runs very cool, no thermal issues
            <br>
            - solid build quality
            <br><br>
            Cons: - Fans get very loud at high speeds
            <br>
            - I'm not a hug fan of the aesthetics
            <br>
            - very thick card, basically a triple slot design, ended up blocking 2 of my SATA ports
            <br><br>
            Overall Review: - I would recommend this to anyone looking to game 1440p 60 ultra on current AAA SP titles and 144hz on AAA multiplayer titles at High settings.
            <br>
            - Esports games (CSGO, valorant, RL) easily hitting 1440p 144hz max settings
            <br>
            - I am honestly surprised at how well this card performs, I was originally looking for a 6800XT or 3080, but this was what I actually got ordered and delivered and I am not disappointed. The card is a beast, especially coming from a RX 480.
