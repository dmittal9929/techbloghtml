      Pros: I really enjoyed the box opening process (as everyone does), I got this card back in late November, just never got around to writing a review. Another good thing about the card is the noise level. It is a very quiet card with great performance and no technical issues upon putting it in my system, running games and applications, and installing drivers, as long as you uninstall all of your previous drivers before installation you should experience the same thing.
      <br><br>
      Cons: Not really much of a con but there's no LED or RGB on the card. Not sure if that's a dealbreaker for you, but if it is then I wouldn't recommend this one.
      <br><br>
      Overall Review: I think it's a great card with a sleek look, not excessively large like a lot of others. It can most likely fit in most cases, considering my case is between small and medium sized. But I would definitely say to purchase this card as it has a great value and great performance to match. (If you can get your hands on it that is)
