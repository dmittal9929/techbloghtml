      <strong>SPECIFICATIONS</strong>
      Architecture: Rocket Lake | Socket: LGA 1200 | Cores/Threads: 8 / 16 | Base Frequency: 3.5GHz | Top Boost Frequency: 5.4GHz | TDP: 125W
      <br><br>
      The eight-core Core i9-11900K slots in as the flagship model for the Rocket Lake family. Fast clock speeds are a clear attraction, but they come at the expense of power â€” two of the chip's cores boost to a peak of 5.3 GHz, and all cores can operate at 4.8 GHz simultaneously. The 11900K has a 125W PL1 power rating (at the base frequency) and a 250W PL2 (boost) rating, both of which are identical to the previous-gen 10900K despite having two fewer cores.
      <br><br>
      The Core i9 K and KF models are Intel's first chips to come with Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT), which allows the processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions (a bit more detail below). This new tech will feel decidedly familiar to AMD fans, as it operates in a very similar fashion to AMD's existing boost mechanism that's present in newer Ryzen processors.
      <br><br>
      The eight-core 16-thread flagship Core i9-11900K comes with a suggested $539 price tag, a $51 markup over the previous-gen ten-core 10900K. The 11900K slots in for $10 less than the Ryzen 9 5900X, which means we're looking at an eight-core chip taking on a 12-core 24-thread chip that will easily beat it in threaded workloads. Intel's obvious goal here is to beat the 5900X at gaming so it can justify the price tag.
